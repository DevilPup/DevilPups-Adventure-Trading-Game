# DevilPups-Adventure-Trading-Game
A little game I'm making just to practice and have something fun I could play in spare time.

A bit of a remake of Space Trader for the PalmOS created by Pieter Spronck. I loved the game back when I was learning to program on a Palm-based knock-off. I don't recall if the original used any form of graphics and, in the same token, I'm not sure that I will either. As I am still a student, the project will increase in complexity as time goes on.
